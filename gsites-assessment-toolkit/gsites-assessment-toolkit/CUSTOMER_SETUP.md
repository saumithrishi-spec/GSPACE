# GSites Assessment Toolkit — Customer Setup Guide

This document describes every change a customer must make before running the toolkit in their environment.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [GAM](https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM) | 7.x | Google Workspace Admin API export |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | 18 or later | Site crawling and API extraction scripts |
| [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) | 7.x (`pwsh`) | Orchestrator and enrichment scripts |
| [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) | Any | OAuth token for Google APIs |

---

## Step 1 — Configure GAM path

Create (or edit) the file `gam.cfg` in the toolkit root folder.  
This file tells the toolkit where `gam.exe` is installed on this machine.

**`gam.cfg`**
```
GAM_PATH=C:\tools\gam\gam.exe
```

Replace the path with the actual location of `gam.exe` on the customer machine.

> **Alternative:** Set the `GAM_PATH` environment variable instead of using `gam.cfg`.
> ```powershell
> $env:GAM_PATH = "C:\tools\gam\gam.exe"
> ```

> **Alternative:** Add the folder containing `gam.exe` to the system `PATH` — the toolkit will find it automatically.

---

## Step 2 — Install Node.js dependencies

Run once from the toolkit root folder:

```powershell
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

---

## Step 3 — Authenticate with Google (browser session)

This step saves a browser login session used by the Playwright crawler.  
Run once per machine, or whenever the session expires.

```powershell
node 02_save_playwright_auth.js
```

A browser window opens. Sign in with the **Google Workspace admin account** that has read access to all Google Sites in the domain. After sign-in completes and a site loads successfully, press **Enter** in the terminal.

This saves credentials to `.auth\state.json`.  
> ⚠️ **Do not commit `.auth\state.json` to source control** — it contains personal session cookies.

---

## Step 4 — Authenticate with gcloud (API token)

Required for Steps 4A (published URLs) and 5 (Forms enrichment).

```powershell
gcloud auth login
```

The toolkit retrieves the token automatically from gcloud on each run.  
To pass the token explicitly:

```powershell
$token = (gcloud auth print-access-token).Trim()
.\Run-FullAssessment.ps1 -PrimaryDomain "yourcompany.com" -AccessToken $token
```

---

## Step 5 — Run the assessment

Always pass `-PrimaryDomain` set to the customer's Google Workspace domain.  
This is used to distinguish internal users from external users in permission analysis.

**Full run (first time):**
```powershell
.\Run-FullAssessment.ps1 -PrimaryDomain "yourcompany.com"
```

**Subsequent runs (GAM export already done):**
```powershell
.\Run-FullAssessment.ps1 -PrimaryDomain "yourcompany.com" -SkipGAMExport -SkipBrowserAuth
```

**Batched run — process 10 sites at a time:**
```powershell
# Batch 1: sites 1–10
.\Run-FullAssessment.ps1 -PrimaryDomain "yourcompany.com" -SkipGAMExport -SkipBrowserAuth -MaxSites 10 -SiteOffset 0

# Batch 2: sites 11–20
.\Run-FullAssessment.ps1 -PrimaryDomain "yourcompany.com" -SkipGAMExport -SkipBrowserAuth -MaxSites 10 -SiteOffset 10
```

**Fast API-based extraction (no browser required):**
```powershell
.\Run-FullAssessment.ps1 -PrimaryDomain "yourcompany.com" -SkipGAMExport -SkipBrowserAuth -UseApiExtract
```

## Customer Changes Summary

| File | What to Change | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `gam.cfg` | Set `GAM_PATH` to the local path of `gam.exe` | ✅ Yes |
| `.auth\state.json` | Regenerate by running `node 02_save_playwright_auth.js` | ✅ Yes (per user) |
| `Run-FullAssessment.ps1` | Pass `-PrimaryDomain "yourcompany.com"` at runtime | ✅ Yes (parameter) |
| `05_score_sites.ps1` | Pass `-PrimaryDomain "yourcompany.com"` if run directly | ✅ Yes (parameter) |

**No other files need to be edited.** All paths, tokens, output directories, and batch sizes are resolved dynamically.
